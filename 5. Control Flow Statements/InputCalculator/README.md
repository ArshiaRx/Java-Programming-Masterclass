* Write a method called inputThenPrintSumAndAverage that does not have any parameters.

* The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to keep reading int numbers from the keyboard.

* When the user enters something that is not an int then it needs to print a message in the format "SUM = XX AVG = YY".

* XX represents the sum of all entered numbers of type int.

* YY represents the calculated average of all numbers of type long.

EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

> EXAMPLE 1:
>
> INPUT:
  >>
  >> 1
  >>
  >> 2
  >>
  >> 3
  >>
  >> 4
  >>
  >> 5
  >>
  >> a
>
> OUTPUT
>
  >> SUM = 15 AVG = 3



> EXAMPLE 2:
>
> INPUT:
> 
  >> hello
>
> OUTPUT:
>
  >> SUM = 0 AVG = 0


NOTE: Do not add the main method to the solution code.
